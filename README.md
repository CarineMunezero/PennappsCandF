### A gamified financial literacy application for rural communities in Rwanda

Fostering financial empowerment and literacy in underserved rural communities across Rwanda through an engaging and gamified learning experience.
According to the World Bank group, about 70 percent of adults in the developing world have no access to financial services, a percentage far higher in rural areas.

Our strong passion for social good, tech and inclusivity, inspired us to foster financial empowerment and literacy in underserved rural communities across Rwanda through an engaging and gamified learning experience with CashEd.

## What it does
The product offers the following five main features:

**Text-message lessons (financial literacy):** CashEd leverages Twilio to send users financial literacy lessons via text messages. These lessons are designed to provide valuable information and insights on managing finances effectively, making informed decisions, and building a secure financial future.

**Quizzes:**  CashEd offers quizzes as an interactive learning tool. Users can take daily quizzes to test their knowledge and understanding of financial concepts. These quizzes not only make learning engaging but also serve as a means for users to measure their progress.

**Language Translation:** To overcome language barriers and ensure that financial education is accessible to a wider audience, CashEd utilizes Google Translate. This feature helps users understand financial lessons and content in their preferred language, making the app inclusive and user-friendly.

**Audience Data Analysis:** CashEd utilizes the Metaphor API to gather data about its user base. This data helps the app understand its audience better, enabling the team to tailor content and features to meet the specific needs and preferences of the users.

**Ranking and Prizes:** CashEd motivates users by providing a ranking system that showcases their performance compared to other users. The prospect of winning mini prizes adds a rewarding aspect to the learning process and can be a powerful incentive for individuals to improve their financial knowledge.

Every feature of our product is highly intentional and user focused. We opted for sending financial literacy lessons because most of our targeted users are often unable to access the internet or smartphones. Second, we used google translate to remove the language barrier hence making our service accessible to everyone regardless of their first language. 

The Metaphor API helps us to know our end-users better and how they are interacting with our product. The quizzes, rankings and mini prizes are designed to offer incentives for learning and motivate users to keep using the service.
