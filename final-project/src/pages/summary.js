              1. What are Bonds?

              Bonds are loans made to corporations or governments. In return for your money,

              called principal, youâ€™ll receive a fixed amount of interest per year,

              plus your money back once the bond expires. Because of this guarantee, bonds

              are the safest of the three investments. They have the lowest potential

              investment return in the long-run  <br/><br/>

              4. What are stocks?

              Stocks represent a piece of ownership in a company, like Apple or Google.

              People buy and sell little pieces of these companies, called shares, in

              places called stock exchanges. When your investment does well, the share price

              goes up and you make money. When your investment does poorly, the share price goes

              down and you lose money. These fluctuations can make stocks risky.
